    Here‚Äôs an overview of Australia:

Geography:

Australia is both a country and a continent.

It‚Äôs the 6th largest country in the world by area, but much of it is desert or semi-arid, called the Outback.

Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it has beautiful coastlines, coral reefs, and unique landscapes.

Population:

Around 26 million people live in Australia (much less compared to India or China).

Most people live in coastal cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.

History:

Indigenous peoples called Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have lived there for over 65,000 years‚Äîone of the world‚Äôs oldest continuous cultures.

Europeans arrived in the 1600s, and Britain colonized it in the late 1700s.

Australia became an independent nation in 1901, though it still recognizes the British monarch as Head of State.
